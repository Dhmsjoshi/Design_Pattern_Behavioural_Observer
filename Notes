Amazon -> Publisher -> Contains list of subscriber objects

10 subscriber -> 10 Objects
Amazon -> 3 Objects (of Amazon class)

1 Object -> 3 Subscribers in the list;
2 Object -> 4 Subscribers in the list;
3 Object -> 3 Subscribers in the list;

Amazon {List}
a1obj -> list
a2obj -> list
a3obj -> list

Whenever we create new subscriber we have to call below methods
register
deregster

But we want to make it smooth as possible.
